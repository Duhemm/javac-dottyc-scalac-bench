# Comparison of javac, scalac and dotc performance

_"Scala is more rich as language than Java and must be slower to compile"_

# A comparison

A simple and fair comparison of compilation speed of `javac`, `scalac` and `dotc` on the source code that requires the same amount of work from all three
compilers. The compiled Scala code is:

```scala
class A1 {
    def f1(x: String): String = x
    def f2(x: String): String = x
    .
    .
    def f100(x: String): String = x
}
```

and for Java:

```java
class A1 {
    String f1(String x) { return x; }
    String f2(String x) { return x; }
    .
    .
    String f100(String x) { return x; }
}
```

For such simple code, Scala and Java coincide perfectly: the language features used are the same and the generated bytecode is the same.

Timing compilation of this simple code establishes a baseline. Both scalac, dotc and javac must perform the same amount of work to produce the output.

## The chart

Running the benchmark yields this chart, though:

![comparison chart](javac-scalac-dotc-chart.png?raw=true "javac scalac dotc chart")

(on the x-axis is the number of generated classes and on y-axis is the number of seconds required to compile)

Let me start with the most astonishing result: `dotc` is a fresh rewrite of the Scala compiler and almost perfectly matches `scalac`'s performance. For a fresh rewrite of that scale, to land at the same performance is remarkable outcome.

By plotting a sequence of measurements and comparing their slopes we can see the relative speed differences between compilers and mitigate fixed costs like startup time. Both `scalac` and `dotc` are 6x slower than `javac`.
