# Comparison of javac, scalac and dotc performance

"Scala is more rich than Java and must be slower to compile"

# A fair comparison

A simple and fair comparison of compilation speed of `javac`, `scalac` and `dotc` on the source code that requires the same amount of work from all three
compilers. The compiled Scala code is:

```scala
class A1 {
    def f1(x: String): String = x
    def f2(x: String): String = x
    .
    .
    def f100(x: String): String = x
}
```

and for Java:

```java
class A1 {
    String f1(String x) { return x; }
    String f2(String x) { return x; }
    .
    .
    String f100(String x) { return x; }
}
```

For such simple code, Scala and Java coincide perfectly: the language features used are the same and the generated bytecode is the same.

Timing compilation of this simple code establishes a baseline. Both scalac, dotc and javac must perform the same amount of work to produce the output.
Running the benchmark yields this chart, though:
